## 🧭 Quick Start — Run a Lesson

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anubhav2321/Python-.git
cd Python-Tutorial
```

2. Open a lesson and run it with Python 3:

```bash
python 01_Introduction/hello_world.py
```

> Tip: Use a virtual environment for larger projects:
>
> ```bash
> python -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
> venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
> ```

## ✨ Sample Mini Projects (What you'll find in `mini_projects/`)

* **atm.py** — simple ATM simulator (PIN check, balance, withdraw, deposit)
* **quiz_app.py** — multiple choice quiz with score tracking
* **coffee_shop.py** — order system that totals prices and handles input
* **snake_game_starter/** — skeleton for creating a snake game with Pygame

Each project contains comments and instructions on how to extend it.
